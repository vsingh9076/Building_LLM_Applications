Vector Databases : The Backbone of Generative AI

To use the embedded information repeatedly, we need to store the embeddings so that they can be accessed on demand. For this purpose, we use a special kind of database called a vector database.

Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings with capabilities like CRUD operations, metadata filtering, and horizontal scaling are crucial for large-scale applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAGs). Vector databases like ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate specialize in this, offering fast retrieval and similarity searches.

Integrating the right vector database is crucial for maximizing RAG performance. A thoughtful selection, considering use case intricacies, ensures seamless storage and retrieval, optimizing the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generative models.
